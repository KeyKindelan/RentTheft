			<p><span class="firstCap">M</span>orrison Tower, LLC paid $24.4 million for the building at 1240 Morrison Ave in 2021. One of its 11th-floor apartments has been unheated for almost three years.

			<p>12-57 Sanford Avenue, LLC paid $40.4 million for a building in Queens. The bathtub drain-pipe in one of its third-floor apartments has been clogged for nearly three years.
			</p>
			<p>West 92nd Street Associates, LLC paid $60 million for 2481-2487 Broadway in Manhattan, the most expensive speculated property with open violations in New York City. A fourth-floor bathtub’s porcelain enamel glaze has been damaged there for more than three-and-a-half years. Enamels are affixed to porcelain with lead-based paints, a well-known health hazard.
			</p>
			<p>Throughout New York City, a majority of speculative landlords are neglecting their properties at the expense of their tenant’s health, all in an attempt to get them out.

			<p>Housing experts say these landlords are not letting their buildings fall into disrepair by accident. These are speculated buildings, bought to replace lower-paying with higher-paying renters, and the majority of speculated buildings in the city are in violation of housing codes. Rent-impairing violations - those that can pose a serious threat to the life, health or safety of the tenant - have been issued on over half of the speculated buildings tracked by the city. 
			</p>
			<p>
			To get tenants out, landlords like these appear to be weaponizing housing code violations to force tenants to leave.
		  </p>

			<p>Landlords push tenants out because “they intend to either demolish the building or do a substantial rehabilitation and take it out of rent stabilization,” or, “they're just stuck and screwed and made a dumb investment,” said Samuel Stein, a housing policy analyst at the Community Service Society. 
			</p>	
			<p>The Landlord Protection Agency, a group advocating for landlords, did not reply to requests for an interview.

			<p><span class="firstCap">Living The Nightmare</span>
			</p>	
			<p><span class="firstCap">R</span>eid MacLean has lived through the nightmare of life-threatening violations. MacLean was born in a rent-controlled apartment at 2481-2487 Broadway. He still lives there 52-years later. 
			</p>
			<p>Inside his own unit he has experienced “constant lead-paint exposure. Lead dust. Even found traces in my children’s blood,” he said.	
			<p>
			After West 92nd Street Associates, LLC bought the building on Mar 2, 2022, “they started to rapid-fire demolish all around us,” he said.</p>
			<p>
			The surrounding renovations caused lead-based paint dust to settle in his apartment. The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development was responsive to his complaints, but not his landlord. 
			</p>

      <p>
			"I still have dust coming in,” he said. “I keep calling HPD. They come, they test it - test positive. They make HPD send a cleaning company to clean. They clean, then they come back and they test, and it’s positive. And I’m stuck in that feedback loop.” </p>
			
			<p>
			"It's been zero communication from the management company,” he added. </p>

			<p><span class="firstCap">The Cost of Doing Business</span>
			</p>	

			<p><span class="firstCap">C</span>ompared to their multi-million dollar price tags, building code violation fines are tiny. </p>

			<p>But, “a lot of landlords simply won't pay them,” said Samuel Stein, the housing policy analyst. The city issues more fines than they actually collect. Occasionally the city “will take landlords to court for not paying. But they don't really have enough lawyers to do that every case,” said Stein.
			</p>

			<p>Fines for violations vary based on many factors, but they don’t accrue when lead-dust enters a unit, or when the tenant lets the housing department know the landlord won’t respond. </p>

			<p>“You typically have to go to court to get a judge to issue an order to correct before the fines start accruing,” said Sateesh Nori, an New York Universtity housing lawyer. </p>

			<p>For tenants, going to court is time-consuming, and the costs are crushing. </p>

			<p>For landlords with multi-million dollar properties, Nori says paying fines is part of the process of owning a building. </p>

			<p>“You ever see a FedEx truck parked on the sidewalk and it’s got like, five or six tickets in the window? And you’re like, ‘why don’t they care?’ And then you think, ‘Oh, that’s the cost of doing business.’”</p>

			<p>For New York landlords, it’s just the cost of doing business. But for tenants, it’s another cold winter with no heat, and no help in sight.</p>
